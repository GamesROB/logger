This is a version of [James Bond#0007](https://github.com/curtisf)'s [open source bot](https://github.com/curtisf/logger) called [Logger](https://top.gg/bot/298822483060981760) modified by [the GamesROB Team](https://github.com/orgs/GamesROB/people) and potentially some [community members](https://github.com/gamesrob/supportbot/graphs/contributors) in the future.

# Running the bot
It's relatively simple/straightforward and as this isn't our main project don't anticipate fast support if something's weird and you're using our fork. If you want or need support and you aren't just using this to toy around with in a test server, you should probably just self-host the project this is based on, [Logger](https://github.com/curtisf/logger). If you just want to have a self-hosted logging bot for privacy reasons like we do, the upstream project this is based on's creator James Bond#0007 is awesome and has a channel dedicated to helping out self-hosters in Logger's support server, [Logger's Lounge](https://discord.gg/ed7Gaa3).


## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome as long as you agree to and consider these guidelines:
- Your idea should make sense in the context of GamesROB's Support Server (if it's scalable and makes sense more broadly for the Logger bot, [check out Logger's contribution section](https://github.com/curtisf/logger#contributing) and we'll pull from upstream).
- Your idea has a chance of being dismissed without a reason by GamesROB Staff if we internally don't think it makes sense.
- In the off chance that we were to remake this from scratch we reserve the right to make the remake closed source even if some funcionality to this public version was contributed by you (as it would effectively be a brand new project in and of itself plus chances are if you really were able to contribute something revolutationary you'd probably just make your own bot or be working directly off the upstream logger project).

If you have done all of the above then open a pull request and we'll review it whenever we get around to it.
