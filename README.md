This is a version of [James Bond#0007](https://github.com/curtisf)'s [open source bot](https://github.com/curtisf/logger) called [Logger](https://top.gg/bot/298822483060981760) modified by [the GamesROB Team](https://github.com/orgs/GamesROB/people) and potentially some [community members](https://github.com/gamesrob/supportbot/graphs/contributors) in the future.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome as long as you agree to and consider these guidelines:
- Your idea should make sense in the context of GamesROB's Support Server (if it's scalable and makes sense more broadly for the Logger bot, [check out Logger's contribution section](https://github.com/curtisf/logger#contributing) and we'll pull from upstream).
- Your idea has a chance of being dismissed without a reason by GamesROB Staff if we internally don't think it makes sense.
- In the off chance that we were to remake this from scratch we reserve the right to make the remake closed source even if some funcionality to this public version was contributed by you (as it would effectively be a brand new project in and of itself).

If you have done all of the above then open a pull request and we'll review it.
