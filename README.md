This is a version of James Bond#0007's [open source](https://github.com/curtisf/logger) [Logger bot](https://top.gg/bot/298822483060981760) modified by [the GamesROB Team](https://github.com/orgs/GamesROB/people) and potentially some [community members](https://github.com/gamesrob/supportbot/graphs/contributors) in the future.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome as long as you agree to and consider these guidelines:
- Your idea should make sense in the context of GamesROB's Support Server (If it doesn't and just makes sense for the Logger bot, [check out this](https://github.com/curtisf/logger#contributing))
- Your idea has a chance of being dismissed without a reason by GamesROB Staff if we internally don't think it makes sense.
- In the off chance that we were to remake this from scratch we reserve the right to make the remake closed source even if some funcionality to this public version was contributed by you.

If you have done all of the above steps, then open a pull request and I will review it. Style guide and testing will be implemented in a later update.
