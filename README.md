# Logger (GamesROB Edition)
This is a fork (modified version) of [curtisf/logger](https://github.com/curtisf/logger). You probably want to check out that repository instead since we don't recommend using our fork.

## Contributing
We *highly* recommend you contribute to the upstream project this is forked from, [curtisf/logger](https://github.com/curtisf/logger). We pull upstream changes every once in a while so eventually your changes there will trickle their way down to us and you'll be improving the experience for a bunch of other people as well!
